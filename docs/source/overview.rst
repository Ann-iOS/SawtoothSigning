Overview
========

This tutorial shows how to use the Sawtooth Swift SDK to develop a
client application. The client is responsible for creating and signing
transactions, combining those transactions into batches, and submitting them to
the validator. The client can post batches through the REST API or connect
directly to the validator via `ZeroMQ <http://zeromq.org>`_.

.. note::

   This tutorial demonstrates the relevant concepts for a Sawtooth
   client, but does not create a complete implementation.
